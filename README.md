# Video-Player-Embedded-in-VF-pafe

We can run video on VF page by two ways:
1. Either using Video tag of HTML

2. Adding a library (in my case JW player) on VF page to run videos. It is easy and can be setup very quickly to run your videos. This will be helpful when your building a Movies/Videos site.

I have added a sample to run by both the ways. Videos are stored in documents and picked by controller.

Hope this helps!
